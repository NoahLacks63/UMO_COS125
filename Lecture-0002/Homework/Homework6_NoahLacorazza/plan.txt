candidates = {
    user_inputted_name : voters
    user_inputted_name : voters
    user_inputted_name : voters
    user_inputted_name : voters
    user_inputted_name : voters
}

voters = [
    voter,
    voter,
    etc
]

voter IDs have to be unique

voter = {
    "ID" : randint()
}

voter rankings must also be unique for every candidate

for voter in voters:
    voter = {
        "ID" : randint()
    }

    for i in range(candidates):
        candidates[name] = randint()

counting votes will proceed until someone has >50%
lowest voted candidate will be eliminated
their tier one voters will then be added to the voter's second rank vote
